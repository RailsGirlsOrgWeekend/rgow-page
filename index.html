      What is with this organizers weekend?
    </h1> 
    <p>
      Since its birth in Finland in 2009, Rails Girls has taken over the world! With events spanning the globe, and our community of contributors growing rapidly, we wanted to take some time to reconnect with these incredible individuals. Over the course of a weekend in June 2014, Rails Girls contributors will meet to discuss the past, present and future of Rails Girls, as well as share in some of the inspiring tales that have been produced by the movement. We will return to the birthplace of Rails Girls, and share an incredible weekend of knowledge sharing, coding, and story-telling, just as the prophecy foretold.

      We're looking for sponsors
    </h2> 
    <p>
      In order to make the Rails Girls organizers weekend happen, we need you! Rails Girls is a not-for-profit network of volunteers, who give their time and energy to events for nothing more than the joy of helping someone learn to code. As such, we need a crack team of sponsor to make this idea a reality. We are looking for sponsors to contribute to the accommodation, and venue of Rails Girls Orga Weekend 2014. As well as this, contributors from all over the globe will need help funding their tickets to Finland. We need an army of willing sponsors to join Rails Girls in helping contributors from the four corners of the globe make it to Finland in June. Whether you want to get behind a Rails Girls team from your city, or get behind the main event in Finland, there is space for you. Click here, to register your sponsorship capabilities, and what you would like to sponsor.
